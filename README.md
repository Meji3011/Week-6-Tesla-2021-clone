# Tesla Clone Project

This project is a clone of the 2021 version of Tesla's website, built using React, Redux, and Firebase. The main goal of this project was to recreate the core functionalities and design elements of the Tesla website while following clean coding practices and best practices for React development.

## Changes compared to original

- React-Router-Dom uses Navigate and useNavigate now instead of history and redirect. Changes were made accordingly.
- React-Router-Dom now uses Routes instead of Switch.
- Firebase simplified some coding syntax, which I'm not sure how to describe as I'm new to the whole procedure of using firebase for authentication.

## Features

- User authentication: The project utilizes Firebase to implement user login functionality, allowing users to create accounts and securely log in to the application.
- State management with Redux: Redux is used for efficient state management throughout the application, ensuring a seamless user experience and maintaining the login state.
- Clean coding practices: The HTML and CSS code follows clean coding practices, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
- Proper file structure: The project adheres to good practices for React file organization, promoting a clear and intuitive file navigation system.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications.
- Firebase: A comprehensive development platform that provides backend services, including authentication and database management.
- HTML5 and CSS3: The latest web standards for structuring and styling the application.

## What's not included

- Reponsiveness
- A functional shopping cart and dynamic account info display that changes based on what you own/bought
- Catalogue of goods and info display for each car/item that Tesla sells.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the tutorial series "Tesla Clone" by alicodes on YouTube. For introductory level of React, Redux, and Firebase, alicodes does a great job guiding you throughout the cloning process so you understand the functions of these technologies.
